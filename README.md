## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- StackBlitz

### What I learned

I learned how to format multiple background images, use "mix-blend-mode: overlay" to hide overlapping images in CSS, and how to position multiple elements with flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) - This is where I created my project.
- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This fun game used frogs to strengthen my flexbox skills.
